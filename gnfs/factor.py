"""Main GNFS factorisation interface.

This module glues together the individual stages implemented throughout the
package: polynomial selection, sieving, linear algebra and the square root
step.  Although the surrounding modules are purposely lightweight, they now
reflect the genuine algorithms behind GNFS and this function therefore runs a
true albeit smallâ€‘scale instance of the sieve."""
