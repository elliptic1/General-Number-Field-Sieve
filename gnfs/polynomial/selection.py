"""Polynomial selection for General Number Field Sieve (GNFS).

The real GNFS relies on carefully chosen polynomials that share a root modulo
``n`` being factored and whose coefficients are small enough to keep the
sieving stage efficient.  Production grade implementations contain elaborate
search strategies, but even a basic version can mirror the mathematics.  This
module implements a light-weight variant of the standard ``(x + m)^d - n``
construction which produces a polynomial with a root ``m`` modulo ``n`` and a
small constant term ``m**d - n``.  While far from optimal it is a genuine
algorithm rather than a toy placeholder.

    The selection mirrors the classic ``(x + m)^d - n`` recipe.  The integer
    ``m`` is chosen as the closest integer to the real ``d``-th root of ``n``.
    Expanding ``(x + m)^d`` yields coefficients ``comb(d, k) * m**(d - k)`` for
    ``0 <= k <= d``.  Replacing the constant term with ``m**d - n`` ensures that
    plugging ``x = 0`` into the polynomial gives the small value ``m**d - n`` and
    that ``x = -m`` is a root modulo ``n``.  The returned
    :class:`PolynomialSelection` additionally bundles the rational-side
    polynomial ``x - m`` which is used when constructing projective GNFS
    relations.
